 // this is a football timmer that works with p10 non-smd LED pannels and controlled by an arduino


// the below code is reffered from p10 library availble in github for arduino

/*This example illustrates two user funcions of LedP10 library
  *First function-showmsg_single_scroll is for scroling of single message on P10 panel with 4 arguments which are message, no. of times of message scrolling, speed and font.
  *for message, pointer to a character string can be passed. For continuously running the message, INF can be passed in second argument, spped can be in range of 0-30, 
   and font can be 0 or 1 as two type of fonts are currently supported for full screen messages. 
   
  * For second function-showmsg_double_scroll, there would be 7 arguments, 2 for messages, two for no. of times of message scrolling, two for speed, and last one for font. 
  * Specification being same as for single scrolling function, except only ont font id provided for double scrolling and it's value should be 0.
